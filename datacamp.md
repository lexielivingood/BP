#Math W/ R

#Addition: 
3 + 4
#Subtraction: 
5 - 5 
#Multiplication:
3 * 5
#Division: (w/ parentheses)
(5 + 5) / 2
#Exponentiation: 
2^5
#Modulo:(remainder of division)
28 %% 6

#STORE A VALUE AS A VARIABLE

#Assign a value 4 to the variable my_var:
my_var <- 4

#type name of variable to print to show value 
my_var

#Add 2 variables together 
my_apples <- 4
my_oranges <- 4
my_apples + my_oranges 

#BASIC DATA TYPES

#adding different data types together won't work
4 + six

#Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
#Whole numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
#Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
#Text (or string) values are called characters.
#quotation marks indicate that "some text" is a string
my_character <- "universe"
my_character 

#CHECK DATA TYPE TO AVOID ERRORS 
class(my_character)
